I'm a frontend dev with a passion for building slick, responsive UIs that make users go "Whoa!" 🚀. Think pixel-perfect designs brought to life with React, TypeScript, and a dash of Redux magic. I've got about a year of hands-on experience, plus some backend chops in Node.js, Express, and Django for those full-stack adventures. When I'm not coding, I'm dreaming up interactive apps that blend speed, style, and seamless UX. Let's turn ideas into digital awesomeness!


🛠️ My Tech Arsenal (Skills That Pack a Punch)

Frontend Superpowers: React.js, TypeScript, Hooks, Redux Toolkit (RTK) – I build UIs that feel alive! ✨
Backend Basics: Node.js, Express, Django – For when the front needs a solid back. 💪
Dev Tools & Tricks: Docker, GitHub Actions, Postman, Git – Containerize, automate, test, repeat. 🛡️
